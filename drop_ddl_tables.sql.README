# Specific Table Deletion Script (delete_ddl_tables.sql)

This script is designed to **permanently delete** only the specific tables that were created by the ddl.sql script. It explicitly lists each table to be dropped, ensuring that no other tables in the schema are affected.

## Tables Targeted for Deletion

The script will attempt to drop the following tables:

* gamereviews
* purchases
* userlibrary
* games
* userachievements
* customers
* developers
* gameservers
* genres
* achievements
* users

## WARNING - Data Loss!

* This script will permanently remove all data and the table structures for the listed tables from the connected schema.
* THERE IS NO UNDO once this script is executed and committed.
* Ensure you have a backup if the data in these tables is valuable.
* Use with extreme caution.

## How it Works

The script uses DROP TABLE table_name CASCADE CONSTRAINTS; for each specified table. CASCADE CONSTRAINTS ensures that any foreign key constraints referencing the table being dropped are also removed, preventing errors due to dependencies.

## How to Use

1.  Connect to the Correct Schema:
    * It is crucial to connect as the user who owns these tables (e.g., game_app_user).
        CONNECT game_app_user/YourSecurePassword123@your_service_name
    * DO NOT run this script as a SYSDBA or SYSTEM user unless you explicitly understand the consequences, as it might attempt to drop tables in the wrong schema.

2.  Run the Script:
    * Save this script as delete_ddl_tables.sql.
    * Execute the script in your Oracle client (e.g., SQL Developer, SQL*Plus) by typing @delete_ddl_tables.sql or running it directly from the IDE.

## Verification

After running, you can try to SELECT * FROM table_name; for any of the listed tables. You should receive an ORA-00942: table or view does not exist error, indicating successful deletion.
